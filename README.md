## Getting Started
To run your Next.js app in development mode, use the following command:
`npm run dev`

This will start a local development server and you can access your app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:
- `app/`: Contains the homepage of your application.
- `app/components/`: Contains all the componets with their native css in a folder format.
- `app/asset`: This folder contains static assets like images, fonts, etc.

## Configuration
Your Next.js app may require some configuration to tailor it to your specific needs. Important configuration files include:
- `next.config.js`: Used to customize the Next.js build and runtime behavior.
- `package.json`: Contains metadata and dependencies for your project.

## Development
During development, consider the following useful scripts:
- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Builds the production-ready app.
- `npm start` or `yarn start`: Starts the production server (after building).
- `npm test` or `yarn test`: Runs tests associated with the project.

## Deployment
To deploy your Next.js app, you have various options. Some popular deployment platforms include:
- Vercel: [Vercel Next.js Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments)
- Netlify: [Netlify Next.js Deployment](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/common-configurations/next-js/)

You can also deploy your app to traditional hosting providers like AWS, Heroku, or any server that supports Node.js applications.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while setting up or running your Next.js app, consider the following:
- Ensure you have installed the correct Node.js and npm/yarn versions.
- Double-check the project configuration files for any errors.
- Check for updates to Next.js and its dependencies.
- Look for solutions in the Next.js community forums or GitHub repository.
